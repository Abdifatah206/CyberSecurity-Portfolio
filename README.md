#### password strength checker
The Password Strength Checker is a Python script designed to evaluate the security of user passwords based on various factors such as length, complexity, and character variety. It provides users with immediate feedback on their password strength and suggests improvements if necessary.

Features:
✅ Evaluates password strength based on length and complexity
✅ Checks for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
✅ Provides a security score (Weak, Moderate, Strong)
✅ Offers suggestions for improving password strength

How It Works:
The user inputs a password.
The script checks the password against predefined security criteria.
The password is categorized as Weak, Moderate, or Strong.
If the password is weak, the program suggests improvements.
